So, letâ€™s say we want to switch from powersave mode to performance mode, we will do:

$ echo performance | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

And if we want to switch back to powersave mode, we will do:

$ echo powersave | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

And to get our current CPU mode, we will type:

$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
